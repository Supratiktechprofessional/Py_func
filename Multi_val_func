#Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction. Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.

def calculation(a, b):
    addition = a + b
    subtraction = a - b
    # return multiple values separated by comma
    return addition, subtraction

# Get input from user
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Call function and get result in tuple
res = calculation(a, b)
print("Result (addition, subtraction):", res)
